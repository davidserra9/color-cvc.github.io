The Color Group at the <a href='https://www.cvc.uab.es/'>Computer Vision Center (CVC)</a> conducts research at the intersection of computer vision, computational imaging, and visual perception, with a particular emphasis on low-level image processing, color and illumination modeling, and image editing. Our work explores the foundations of color science while addressing practical challenges in image enhancement, restoration, and scene understanding.

Faculty and students in the Color Group are affiliated with the <a href='https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html'>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,</a> within the Department of Computer Science.
