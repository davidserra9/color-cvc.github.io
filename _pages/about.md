The Color Group at the <a href='https://www.cvc.uab.es/'>Computer Vision Center (CVC)</a> conducts research at the intersection of computer vision, computational imaging, and visual perception, with a particular emphasis on low-level image processing, color and illumination modeling, and image editing. Our work explores the foundations of color science while addressing practical challenges in image enhancement, restoration, and scene understanding.

Faculty and students in the Color Group are affiliated with the <a href='https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html'>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,</a> within the Department of Computer Science.

## Why Work in Color?

Color is a fundamental aspect of visual perception and image understanding, yet it remains one of the most challenging areas in computer vision. Our research addresses critical problems where color plays a central role:

**Color Editing and Enhancement** — We develop methods for intelligent color manipulation, from white balance correction to artistic style transfer, enabling photographers and artists to achieve their creative vision while maintaining photorealistic results.

**Image Relighting** — Understanding and manipulating illumination in images is key to realistic rendering and scene understanding. We work on techniques to decompose, edit, and synthesize lighting conditions in photographs.

**Computational Color** — From camera image signal processing (ISP) pipelines to color correction and gamut mapping, we tackle the technical challenges that bridge the gap between physical light capture and perceptually accurate display.

**Color in Large Models** — As foundation models reshape computer vision, we investigate how these systems perceive and reason about color, addressing questions of color consistency, semantic understanding, and bias in large-scale visual models.

**Intrinsic Image Decomposition** — Separating images into their fundamental components—reflectance, shading, and illumination—is essential for understanding scenes. We develop methods that decompose images to enable advanced editing and analysis.

Our work combines theoretical foundations in color science with modern deep learning techniques, resulting in practical solutions for real-world applications in photography, graphics, and visual computing.
