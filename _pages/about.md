The Color Group at the <a href='https://www.cvc.uab.es/'>Computer Vision Center (CVC)</a> conducts research at the intersection of computer vision, computational imaging, and visual perception. Our work explores the foundations of color science while addressing practical challenges in image enhancement, relighting, restoration, and scene understanding.

Over the last 10 years, the Color Group at CVC has published more than 60 papers in relevant international journals and conferences. Regularly the group publishes in top-tier computer vision conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, as well as specialized venues like SIGGRAPH, CIC, and 3DV. We actively collaborate with researchers from both academia and industry worldwide, developing projects sponsored by both public and private funds.

Faculty and students in the Color Group are affiliated with the <a href='https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html'>Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,</a> within the Department of Computer Science.

### Why Work in Color?

Color is a fundamental aspect of visual perception and image understanding, yet it remains one of the most challenging areas in computer vision. Our research addresses critical problems where color plays a central role, some of which are:

**Color Editing and Enhancement**: We develop methods for interpretable and controllable color manipulation, from color harmonization to image retouching, enabling photographers and artists to achieve their creative vision while maintaining photorealistic results.

**Image Relighting**: Light and color are always entangled in images. Therefore, understanding and manipulating illumination in images is key to realistic rendering and scene understanding. We work on techniques to decompose, edit, and synthesize lighting conditions in images. We have created fine-grained datasets and methods that pushed forward the field.

**Computational Color**: From camera image signal processing (ISP) pipelines to color correction gamut mapping, we tackle the technical challenges that bridge the gap between physical light capture and perceptually accurate display.

**Color in Large Models**: As foundation models reshape computer vision, we investigate how these systems perceive and reason about color, addressing questions of color perception, semantic understanding, text similarities, and biases in large-scale visual models.

**Intrinsic Image Decomposition**: Separating images into their fundamental components (reflectance, shading, and illumination) is essential for understanding scenes. We develop methods that decompose images to enable advanced editing and analysis.

Our work combines theoretical foundations in color science with modern deep learning techniques, resulting in practical solutions for real-world applications in photography, graphics, and visual computing.
